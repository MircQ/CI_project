All the experiments led to an improvement of the results with respect to the base classifiers. The best result is reached from the Weighted Average Voting, which permitted to pass from 70% to 73% in accuracy. In general, Average Voting classifiers provided better results than Majority Voting because of their higher robustness. "]}]}
